# Creating-Usernames-From-Excel-File
Given an excel file (HSA_Freshman_3010.xlsx) that contains the student names of the new incoming freshman class, generate their usernames.
#
Usernames must follow this style:
student.first_name_initial.last_name@horizoncolumbus.org

# For example
if a student is named Nana Yeboah, his username must be: student.n.yeboah@horizoncolumbus.org
